"It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree. Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to." —Elon Musk

"The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks." —Mortimer Adler
